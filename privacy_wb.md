None of the data this app stores is personally identifiable information. This application stores your game settings and game results in internal protected files, and this data is not shared.
In match mode the application stores the letter you choose and your final score in a third party cloud database. It is for this reason network permission is required.
This data is deleted after the game is finished, or normally within a maximum of an hour if the game is abandoned.
